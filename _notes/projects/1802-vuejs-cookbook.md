# Secret Vue.js Cookbook
> This cookbook is still in its very early stages. At this point, we will not be linking to it from anywhere else. Pages may be removed or reorganized at any time. Even the goals and overall format are still in flux.

## Contribution
The Cookbook gives developers examples to work off of that both cover common or interesting use cases, and also progressively explain more complex detail. Our goal is to move beyond a simple introductory example, and demonstrate concepts that are more widely applicable, as well as some caveats to the approach.

If youâ€™re interested in contributing, please initiate collaboration by filing an issue under the tag cookbook idea with your concept so that we can help guide you to a successful pull request. After your idea has been approved, please follow the template below as much as possible. Some sections are required, and some are optional. Following the numerical order is strongly suggested, but not required.

### Simple Example
required

* Articulate the problem in a sentence or two.
* Explain the simplest possible solution in a sentence or two.
* Show a small code sample.
* Explain what this accomplishes in a sentence.

### Details about the Value
required

Address common questions that one might have while looking at the example. (Blockquotes are great for this)
Show examples of common missteps and how they can be avoided.
Show very simple code samples of good and bad patterns.
Discuss why this may be a compelling pattern. Links for reference are not required but encouraged.

### Real-World Example
required

Demonstrate the code that would power a common or interesting use case, either by:

* Walking through a few terse examples of setup
* Embedding a codepen/jsfiddle example

_Additional Context_
* When To Avoid This Pattern
* Alternative Patterns
